                        All of them are located in the Northern part of Ethiopia: Lake Tana: This is the 
                        largest lake in Ethiopia and the source of the Blue Nile. It is also home to many
                         ancient monasteries and churches, some of which are located on islands. You can 
                         take a boat tour to explore the lake and its religious sites. Debre Berhan Selassie Church 
                         is one of the most beautiful churches in Ethiopia, located in the historic city of Gondar. 
                         It is famous for its stunning ceiling paintings, which depict hundreds of angels with different 
                         facial expressions.National Park: This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that boasts 
                         spectacular scenery and wildlife. You can hike among jagged peaks, deep valleys and 
                         waterfalls, and encounter rare animals like the gelada baboon, the walia ibex and

                    <p id="travel-tips-para">
                        Some of the best recommendations or advice for tourists around the world to know 
                        while they are coming to visit Ethiopia are: Check the visa requirements: Depending 
                        on your nationality, you may need a visa to enter Ethiopia. You can apply for an 
                        e-visa online or get a visa on arrival at Addis Ababa airport. Make sure you have 
                        a valid passport, a return ticket and enough money for your stay. Pack appropriately: 
                        Ethiopia has different climates and altitudes, so you should pack layers and warm 
                        clothes, especially if you plan to visit the highlands or the mountains. You should 
                        also bring sun protection, insect repellent, a first aid kit and any medications you 
                        may need. Be respectful of the culture and religion: Ethiopia is a diverse country 
                        with many ethnic groups and religions. You should respect the local customs and 
                        traditions, such as dressing modestly, greeting people properly, and avoiding public 
                        displays of affection. You should also be aware of the religious festivals and holidays, 
                        such as Orthodox Christian fasting days, when some restaurants and attractions may be 
                        closed or have limited services.Try the local food and drink: Ethiopia has a rich 
                        and varied cuisine that you should not miss. You can try dishes like injera 
                        (a sourdough flatbread), wat (a spicy stew), tibs (grilled meat), and shiro 
                        (a chickpea paste). You can also enjoy the famous Ethiopian coffee, which is 
                        often served in a traditional ceremony with incense and popcorn. Bargain wisely: 
                        Ethiopia is a relatively cheap country to travel in, but you should still 
                        bargain for goods and services, such as souvenirs, taxis, and tours. However, 
                        you should not be too aggressive or rude when bargaining, as this may offend the 
                        sellers or drivers. You should also be aware of the exchange rate and the local 
                        currency, which is the Ethiopian birr
